=====================

Another implementation of ReactiveArray package for Meteor, taking into consideration the Javascript's native array mutator, accessor and iteration methods, making them reactive.

### Usage

Just assign a new instance of ReactiveArray to a variable and you're done.

i.e.: `var reactive_array = new ReactiveArray();`

ALL ARRAY'S MUTATOR, ACCESSOR AND ITERATION METHODS (SEE [REFERENCE][1]) ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL INSTANCES OF REACTIVEARRAY AND THEY'RE ALL REACTIVE. ALL MUTATOR METHODS TRIGGER A RECOMPUTATION OF WHATEVER THE REACTIVEARRAY INSTANCES ARE BEING USED IN.

### Important notes

The ReactiveArray instances are not array-like objects. Therefore, they cannot be called within `Array.prototype.[any_method].call` nor `Array.prototype.[any_method].apply` as the context (`this` variable). What _CAN_ be used as the context in such cases is the array returned by the `get()` method, _BUT_ these calls will not be reactive.

### Methods

<a name="methods-constructor">
#### Constructor:
`ReactiveArray(initialValue, equalsFunction, makeArrayObjectReactive) -> Object`

**initialValue: Array**
The array's initial value. Becomes the ReactiveArray instance's built-in array object.

**initialValue: [Anything]** (2)
The array's initial value. Is wrapped inside a Javascript regular array and becomes the ReactiveArray instance's built-in array object.
Default: `[]`

**equalsFunction: Function(oldValue: Array, newValue: Object) -> Boolean**
A function that receives the arguments `oldValue` and `newValue` and evaluates their equality.
When set, this function will be called inside [Set](#methods-set).
By default this method just returns `false` (given `newValue` is an object and it may just be `oldValue` mutated), forcing the variable to always be updated on every `set(newValue)` call.

**makeArrayObjectReactive: Boolean**
As seen in [Important notes](#important-notes), the ReactiveArray instances are not array-like objects, but _THEY HAVE_ a built-in array that is returned by [Get](#methods-get).
When this argument is set to `true` (which is default), the array object returned by `get()` becomes reactive. If set to `false`, the returned array will be just a regular non-reactive Javascript array.

<a name="methods-set">
#### Set:
`reactive_array_var.set(value);`

Sets the built-in array object contained inside the ReactiveArray instance.
Uses the `equalsFunction` (see [Constructor](#methods-constructor)) as equality evaluator to decide wether or not to update the variable. If `equalsFunction` returns a falsy value, which means the old and new values are _DIFFERENT_, then the variable _IS_ updated. Otherwise, there is no update.

**value: Array**
Becomes the instance's built-in array object.

**value: [Anything]** (2)
Is wrapped inside a regular Javascript array and becomes the instance's array object.

**Caution**
This method will make the newly set array to be reactive, if defined upon the ReactiveArray instance creation (see [Constructor](#methods-constructor)).

**Caution 2**
Calling this method with no argument will cause `value` to be considered `undefined`. So this would be the same as calling `set([undefined])`. To clear the array, see [Clear](#methods-clear).

<a name="methods-get">
#### Get:
`reactive_array_var.get() -> Array`

Returns the built-in array object contained inside the ReactiveArray instance. If defined upon the ReactiveArray instance creation, this array may be reactive (see [Constructor](#methods-constructor)).

<a name="methods-remove">
#### Remove:
`reactive_array_var.remove(valueOrEvaluationFunction) -> Array`

Returns a regular Javascript array containing all removed elements evalueated by `valueOrEvaluationFunction` as truthy, if `valueOrEvaluationFunction` is a function, or strictly equal to `valueOrEvaluationFunction` otherwise.

**valueOrEvaluationFunction: Function(element: [Anything]) -> Boolean**

Evaluation function that returns a truthy value meaning that `element` should be removed or a falsy value otherwise.

**valueOrEvaluationFunction: [Anything]** (2)

A value that is wrapped in a strict equality evaluation function to evaluate which elements of the array should be removed.

<a name="methods-clear">
#### Clear:
`reactive_array_var.clear()`

Clears the instance's built-in array object. It's a shorthand of `set([])`.
